My name is Long Chen (陈龙), and I am currently a third-year master student in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/), Hefei University of Technology, supervised by [Rui Sun (孙锐)](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/sr1/zh_CN/index.htm). I'm going to be a 2025 Ph.D. Candidate in [Nankai University](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/), supervised by [Dengping Fan (范登平)](https://dengpingfan.github.io/pages/People.html) and [Xiang Li (李翔)](https://implus.github.io/). My research interests are computer vision and robust multi-modal learning. Recently I have been focusing on Efficient MLLMs.
